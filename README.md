This is a project for the [_TheOdinProject_](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors) curriculum. It is a [_rock, paper, scissors_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors) game played between an user and computer. For now, It is all in the console. GUI will be implemented later on.
